Baker studied Mechanical Engineering and Materials Science. He received his PhD in Materials Science and Engineering at Stanford University in 1993, was a staff scientist at the Max-Planck-Institut f\u00fcr Metallforschung in Stuttgart from 1993 to 1997 and joined the Cornell faculty in 1998. He was Visiting Professor at the Facult\u00e9 des Sciences et Techniques de Saint J\u00e9rome, Universit\u00e9 Paul C\u00e9zanne, Marseille, in summer 2006. Baker has received several teaching awards at Cornell.\nResearch Interests\nBaker\u2019s research focuses on the unique mechanical properties of materials having microstructural or dimensional length scales in the nanometer regime. Work in the group can be divided into two broad areas.\nThin Films and Nanopatterned Structures are the basic building blocks of micro- and nano-fabricated devices, but may have mechanical properties that are very different from those of the same materials in bulk form. We want to understand (and utilize) these unique properties. We produce films with good control of interface chemistry and composition using high- and ultra-high vacuum physical vapor deposition techniques; characterize their microstructures using electron backscattered diffraction, transmission electron microscopy, and many other methods; and study their thermomechanical behavior using substrate curvature, x-ray diffraction, and others. We model the microstructure and stress states in detail in order to understand processing-structure-properties relationships. Recent achievements include discovery of a new microstructure in Ta thin films and characterization of the phase transformation that produces it, x-ray studies of stress states and relaxation in different texture components in thin metal films, dislocation dynamics simulations and analytical modeling of dislocation structures in thin layers, and quantitative measurements of bonding at interfaces by time-dependent delamination experiments.\nNanocontact Measurements are a powerful method for interrogating mechanical behavior on an extremely fine scale. Recently, with a team of collaborators, we have been using these methods to investigate structure-property relationships in the lamellar and interlamellar regions in trabecular bone as a function of age and vitamin D deficiency.\nResearch Projects\nStresses and Deformation Mechanisms in Thin Metal Films: Combining Modeling with Experiments. In this NSF-funded project, we are studying how the evolution of grain and dislocation structures affects stress states, strength and strain hardening in thin metal films. We use discrete dislocation dynamics to study dislocation structures and compare the results with experimental measurements of microstructure and stresses.\nMicrostructure and Mechanical Behavior of Tantalum Thin Films: Ta is an amazingly versatile and useful material in micro- and nano-fabricated devices. In this NSF-funded project, we are analyzing the long-range orientation gradients and discontinuous grain boundary structure in a new microstructure that we discovered in phase-transformed Ta thin films using experimental and computational methods.\nStresses and Deformation in Different Texture Components in Thin Films: Thin films often form with more than one group of preferred crystallographic orientations, or textures. Since most materials are highly anisotropic at the nanoscale, these differently-oriented components have very different properties. With support from Applied Materials Corp. we study how these texture components behave in-situ using x-ray diffraction at the Cornell High Energy Synchrotron Source.\nA Materials Research Approach to Bone: Nanometer Scale Microstructure and Mechanical Properties: Bone is a complex composite material with structure and organization at many length scales. In this NSF-funded project, we are using nanoindentation to understand the structure-properties in the constituents on the micrometer length scale and their dependence on species, age, and nutrition.\n \nComputational Mechanics\nAdvanced Materials\nMaterials Synthesis and Processing\nComputational Solid Mechanics\nEnergy Systems\nEnergy and the Environment\nMechanics of Biological Materials\nTeaching Interests\nBaker teaches courses that focus on the mechanical properties of materials, thin films, microstructure of materials, and metallurgy.\nService Interests\nBaker is interested in undergraduate engineering education and served as the Director of Undergraduate Studies for the Department of Materials Science and Engineering from 2004 through 2010. He also chaired the College of Engineering Curriculum Task Force that examined the Engineering Common Curriculum in 2006. Baker is very active in the Materials Research Society, an international professional society of about 16,000 members. He was the President of that organization in 2009 and has served as Symposium Organizer, Meeting Chair, Committee Chair, and was a member of the Board of Directors for several years. He helped to form the Nanoscale Informal Science Education (NISE) network and has participated in a wide range of science and materials education related projects.\nSelect Publications\nKim, Y Y., J D.

As a postdoctoral fellow she studied skeletal tissue biology and biophysical imaging in Biomedical Sciences at Cornell and material properties of osteoporotic bone in the Mineralized Tissues Laboratory at the Hospital for Special Surgery.\nDr. Donnelly received an NIH Ruth L Kirchstein National Research Service Award for her postdoctoral fellowship at HSS examining the effects of bone tissue mineral and collagen properties on fracture incidence. She received the American Society for Bone and Mineral Research\u2019s Young Investigator Award in 2010 and Junior Faculty Osteoporosis Research Award in 2012 for her work on the effects of bisphosphonates on bone tissue properties. She received the New Investigator Recognition Award from the Orthopedic Research Society in 2009 and the Alice L. Jee Memorial Young Investigator Award from the Sun Valley Workshop on Skeletal Tissue Biology in 2007 for her work on imaging primary cilia in skeletal tissues. In 2103 she received an NIH K01 award to study bone material properties and mechanical behavior in Type 2 diabetic patients and in 2015 received an NSF CAREER award, \u201cCAREER: Role of Variations in Tissue Material Properties in Bone Fracture Behavior.\u201d\nResearch Interests\nThe focus of the lab is characterization of the contribution of tissue microstructure and composition to the material and structural behavior of healthy and pathologic connective tissues. The primary research focus is on the contribution of the organic and inorganic bone tissue constituents to material properties and whole-bone strength. The long-term goals of the work are to integrate materials science with translational orthopedic research to develop a mechanistic understanding of pathologic fractures in bone to (1) identify the factors that contribute to the integrity of healthy bone tissue (\u201cbone quality\u201d) and (2) improve prediction of structural failure and treatments that may restore function to diseased bone tissue.\nThe primary focus is translational studies that act at the interface between basic science and clinical research, with the goal of translating basic science results to the clinic to improve prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of diseases that degrade tissue integrity. In addition, the translational studies are supported with fundamental studies in model systems. Workhorse techniques include Fourier transform infrared imaging and Raman imaging, as well as multiphoton microscopy, atomic force microscopy, and nanoindentation.\nBiomedical Engineering\nBiomechanics and Mechanobiology\nMechanics of Biological Materials\nBioengineering\nSelect Publications\nHunt HB, Torres AM, Palomino PM, Marty E, Saiyed R, Cohn M, Jo J, Warner S, Sroga GE, King KB, Lane JM, Vashishth D, Hernandez CJ, Donnelly E.

Estroff received her B.A. with honors from Swarthmore College (1997), with a major in Chemistry and a minor in Anthropology. Before beginning her graduate studies, she spent a year at the Weizmann Institute of Science in Rehovot, Israel as a visiting researcher in the labs of Profs Lia Addadi and Steve Weiner. During this time, she was introduced to the field of biomineralization and studied chemical approaches to archeological problems. In 2003, she received her Ph.D. in Chemistry from Yale University for work done in Prof. Andrew D. Hamilton\u2019s laboratory on the design and synthesis of bio-inspired organic superstructures to control the growth of inorganic crystals. After completing graduate school, she was an NIH-funded postdoctoral fellow in Prof. George M. Whiteside\u2019s laboratory at Harvard University (2003-2005). Since 2005, Dr. Estroff has been in Materials Science and Engineering department at Cornell University and in 2019 she was promoted to Full Professor. She served as the Director of Graduate Studies in the department from 2015-2019. As of August 2020, she is the current Chair of the Materials Science and Engineering department. Her group focuses on bio-inspired materials synthesis, crystal growth mechanisms, and the high-resolution characterization of pathological mineralization.\nResearch Interests\nThe diversity of biomineralized structures, ranging from magnetic nanoparticles in bacteria to large, single-crystalline sea urchin spines to the hierarchical composite structure of bone, has inspired the study of structure-function relationships within naturally occurring materials, and the development of synthetic routes to organic-inorganic composites with complex morphologies and desirable materials properties. Central to the study of biomineralization, and still poorly understood, are the multiple crystallization pathways by which the organisms control the structures and properties of the final products. Once these pathways are understood, they become synthetically powerful for designing new materials and developing low-cost, solution-based approaches to functional materials. In addition to normal, physiological biomineralization, a related field is the study of pathlogical mineralization, i.e., conditions in which the normal pathways have become disrupted. Here too, unraveling the crystallization pathways is essential to aid in the discovery of diagnostic and therapeutic approaches for treating diseases linked with pathological mineralization. Dr. Estroff has established a robust research program to tackle these open questions at both a fundamental and applied level.\nDr. Estroff\u2019s research is rooted in the fundamental study of solution crystal growth mechanisms, with applications in fields ranging from biomineralization and pathological mineralization to synthetic bio-inspired crystalline materials. Within these larger fields, Dr. Estroff has concentrated her research efforts in 4 general areas: 1) state-of-the-art materials characterization (e.g., chemical, structural, mechanical, etc.) of physiological and pathological biominerals; 2) in situ evaluation of crystal growth mechanisms in materials ranging from the biologically relevant calcite to the emerging photovoltaic material, hybrid organic-inorganic perovskites; 3) the development of bio-inspired synthetic strategies (e.g., confinement, patterned growth, organic templates) to create new crystalline materials with complex morphologies, compositions, and properties; and 4) the design of in vitro models of cell-mineral interactions and tissue engineered constructs that recapitulate key features of biomineralization.\nPolymers and Soft Matter\nMechanics of Biological Materials\nBiomedical Imaging and Instrumentation\nBiomedical Engineering\nBioengineering\nTissue Engineering and Biomaterials\nBiomechanics and Mechanobiology\nTeaching Interests\nMaterials Chemistry, biomaterials, biomineralization, biomedical materials.\nSelect Publications\nPalin, D., Style, R.W., Zlopasa, J., Petrozzini, J.J., Pfeifer, M.A., Jonkers, H.M., Dufresne, E.R., Estroff, L.A.* \u201cForming Anisotropic Crystal Composites: Assessing the Mechanical Translation of Gel Network Anisotropy to Calcite Crystal Form \u2197\u201d, J.

      "research_interests": "Research Interests\nThe diversity of biomineralized structures, ranging from magnetic nanoparticles in bacteria to large, single-crystalline sea urchin spines to the hierarchical composite structure of bone, has inspired the study of structure-function relationships within naturally occurring materials, and the development of synthetic routes to organic-inorganic composites with complex morphologies and desirable materials properties. Central to the study of biomineralization, and still poorly understood, are the multiple crystallization pathways by which the organisms control the structures and properties of the final products. Once these pathways are understood, they become synthetically powerful for designing new materials and developing low-cost, solution-based approaches to functional materials. In addition to normal, physiological biomineralization, a related field is the study of pathlogical mineralization, i.e., conditions in which the normal pathways have become disrupted. Here too, unraveling the crystallization pathways is essential to aid in the discovery of diagnostic and therapeutic approaches for treating diseases linked with pathological mineralization. Dr. Estroff has established a robust research program to tackle these open questions at both a fundamental and applied level.\nDr. Estroff\u2019s research is rooted in the fundamental study of solution crystal growth mechanisms, with applications in fields ranging from biomineralization and pathological mineralization to synthetic bio-inspired crystalline materials. Within these larger fields, Dr. Estroff has concentrated her research efforts in 4 general areas: 1) state-of-the-art materials characterization (e.g., chemical, structural, mechanical, etc.) of physiological and pathological biominerals; 2) in situ evaluation of crystal growth mechanisms in materials ranging from the biologically relevant calcite to the emerging photovoltaic material, hybrid organic-inorganic perovskites; 3) the development of b",

His doctoral work focused on using scanning superconducting sensors to visualize the electronic properties of superconductors and topological insulators. He then moved to the Max Planck Institute for Chemical Physics of Solids in Dresden, where he is developing techniques to probe and control the properties of superconducting and magnetic materials. He will join the Cornell faculty in 2026 as an assistant professor.\nResearch Interests\nResearch in our group revolves around developing new approaches for identifying and controlling the electronic properties of quantum materials. These materials exhibit behavior which is unavailable in the semiconductors, metals and insulators which make up the majority of our information processing devices. Quantum materials have the potential to enable both new energy-efficient devices as well as unlock fundamentally new approaches to information processing. Much of this potential remains untapped and research in our group is focused on unlocking the new electronic functionality promised by quantum materials.\nUniaxial Strain Control \nControlling the spacing between atoms in a material is a powerful way to control its properties. Accordingly, the application of strain or pressure to quantum materials provides a route towards systematically optimizing the electronic properties of a new material system. Our group utilizes piezoelectric uniaxial strain cells to explore the response of quantum materials to strain in situ down to millikelvin temperatures and in high magnetic fields. We bring a wide array of characterization tools, including transport, thermodynamic, and structural probes to bear in order to unravel the complicated structure-property relationships in quantum materials.\nTransport Phenomena \nElectronic transport measurements serve as a compass in quantum materials characterization, guiding us towards the discovery of new electronic states of matter. Emerging materials systems are often first synthesized as small single crystals. Our group utilizes micro-structuring techniques based on focused ion beams to sculpt high-quality single crystals into devices suitable for precision electronic transport characterization. Our approach allows emerging materials systems to be integrated with metallic, magnetic and superconducting thin-films, enabling proof-of-concept demonstrations of the new electronic behavior available in quantum materials.\nThermodynamic Sensing \nThermodynamic information\u2014including magnetic, elastic, and thermal properties\u2014offers deep insights into the nature quantum materials. Traditional thermodynamic measurement techniques are often limited by sample volume, making these measurements challenging in a broad class of materials with immense potential for technological applications. Due to these constraints, thermodynamic information is often missing precisely when the most reliable experimental input is needed. We are interested in developing techniques to extract thermodynamic information from micro to nanoscale samples. For example, we use superconducting sensors to conduct magnetic measurements thin-film samples, lamellae extracted from bulk single crystals, and atomically-thin van-de Waals heterostructures. We will also leverage our ability to micro-structure samples with thee-dimensional reliefs to fabricate micro-mechanical resonators from emerging materials systems, providing information about the elastic properties and the coupling of the electronic degrees of freedom to the lattice.\nSelect Publications\nG.

He is a Fellow of the American Chemical Society and of the Polymer Materials Science and Engineering Division of the American Chemical Society. He has won the 2014 Cooperative Research Award from the American Chemical Society, and he is a member of the European Academy of Sciences.\nResearch Interests\nResearch in our group focuses on energy production, conversion, and storage. Currently, our efforts center around two main themes: (a) the design and synthesis of nanoparticles that self-assemble at interfaces and control the properties of emulsions and foams, and (b) the development of high surface area porous materials, including porous carbons, as sorbents and catalyst supports.\nEmulsions and Foams \nWe investigate specially engineered nanoparticles that can withstand high-temperature, high-salinity environments and assemble at liquid\u2013liquid or liquid\u2013air interfaces. The assembly behavior\u2014and ultimately the system\u2019s properties\u2014can be fine-tuned by controlling various parameters such as nanoparticle size, surface chemistry, and surface charge. Originally developed for oil\u2013water emulsions, our work has expanded to include systems for CO\u2082 storage and the remediation of nanoplastics and perfluorinated compounds (\u201cforever chemicals\u201d). A notable outcome of this research is the development of fluorine-free oil-repellent coatings. This technology has been licensed by DryFiber and recently led to a joint development agreement with AGC Chemicals Americas Inc. to produce and commercialize the coatings for nonwoven fabrics and technical textiles. Discussions are underway with a new startup to license and commercialize this newly developed PFAS remediation technology.\nPorous Materials \nA recent addition to our portfolio of synthetic approaches includes the use of hypergolic reactions\u2014typically used in rocket propulsion\u2014as a novel synthetic route for porous materials. In that respect, we recently demonstrated a family of carbons with record-high surface area and porosity. These materials exhibit excellent CO\u2082 sorption capabilities with extremely fast adsorption kinetics. In addition, when employed as supercapacitor electrodes, they deliver exceptionally high volumetric energy density and power (the highest reported for activated carbons). The unique experimental conditions of hypergolic reactions offer a novel pathway for designing and synthesizing electrocatalysts with enhanced properties, a direction currently being extended to nanoparticle and single-atom catalysts.\nCarbon-based Single Atoms Electrocatalysts \nA recent extension of our synthetic approaches focuses on the design and development of single-atom electrocatalysts (SACs), in which metal active sites are atomically dispersed on various substrates including carbon-based supports, to drive advanced electrocatalysis and electrochemical conversion reactions. A central emphasis is placed on the electrochemical reduction of CO\u2082, with the goal of enhancing catalytic activity, improving product selectivity, and suppressing competing side reactions. Beyond their practical advantages, SACs serve as model systems with well-defined active centers, enabling mechanistic studies and the establishment of fundamental structure\u2013property relationships.\nSelect Publications\nLi, L., S.

Burr Professor of Engineering at Cornell University.  He is in the departments of Electrical and Computer Engineering and Materials Science and Engineering, and is a field member in the department of Applied and Engineering Physics.  He joined Cornell in 2015 from the faculty at Notre Dame where he was since August 2003, shortly after earning the Ph.D. in Electrical and Computer Engineering from the University of California, Santa Barbara (UCSB).\nHis teaching and research are in the quantum physics of semiconductors and electronic and photonic devices based on quantized semiconductor structures (e.g. Nitrides, Oxides, 2D Materials), and their heterostructures with superconductors, ferroelectrics and magnets, with device applications in energy-efficient transistors, light-emitting diodes and RF and power electronics and quantum computation and communications.  His research is driven by the goal to enable orders of magnitude increase in the energy efficiency and speed for computation, memory, communications, lighting, and electrical energy management ranging from the chip to the grid.\nThe research from his group has been published in more than 300 journal papers including in Science, Nature, Physical Review Letters, Applied Physics Letters and Electron Device Letters. Several patents have been granted for the group\u2019s research work.  He is a fellow of the American Physical Society and is the winner of teaching awards and research awards such as the ISCS young scientist award in 2012, MBE young scientist award in 2014, and awards from the industry such as the IBM faculty award in 2012, and most recently the Intel Outstanding Research award in 2020.\nResearch Interests\nThe Jena group explores the fundamental limits of computation, memory, and communications with semiconductor devices by exploiting and understanding new physics. In recent years, they are immersed in research on the following topics:\nthe performance limits of ultrahigh speed GaN and AlN transistors for all-electronic THz sources,\nultra wide bandgap semiconductor transistors for power electronics (see Energy.gov presentation),\nphotonic devices in the IR & visible, and deep-UV LEDs and lasers approaching 200 nm using quantum dots,\nultra-low power electronics: logic and memory exploiting spintronics, topological insulators, and superconductors, and\nnovel materials and devices for quantum computation and communication that go far beyond classical device limits.\nOften this research path requires us to explore new materials. We grow the new materials by ourselves using Molecular Beam Epitaxy (MBE), or work very closely with groups that do. Currently the materials families we are investigating for the above devices are:\nNitride semiconductors (and nitride superconductors, magnets, and ferroelectrics),\nGraphene, hBN & 2D Crystals, and\nOxide semiconductors, ferroelectrics, and multiferroics.\nThe goal to make devices also requires, or results in, a deep theoretical understanding of electron transport, electron-phonon interactions, light-matter interactions, geometric and topological aspects of condensed matter physics, and correlated electron physics.

After several years in industry at the Xerox Research Centre of Canada, Ober arrived at Cornell in 1986. His research is focused on lithography, patterning, the biology materials interface and control of surface structure in thin films. As a reflection of his contributions to lithography, Ober in 2015 was honored with the Photopolymer Science & Technology Outstanding Contribution Award. He is the 2006 winner of the American Chemical Society Award in Applied Polymer Science, and received a Humboldt Research Prize in 2007. In 2009, Ober was named a Fellow of the American Chemical Society and was awarded the Gutenberg Research Prize by the University of Mainz. Ober served as Interim Dean of Engineering 2009 \u2013 2010. In 2014 he was a JSPS Fellow in Japan. More recently he was elected a fellow of APS (2014) and AAAS (2015) and made a SPIE Senior Member (2018). He is currently the Director of the Cornell Nanoscale Facility.\nResearch Interests\nThe ability to tailor the chemical structure of materials provides the ability to exquisitely control materials properties. Polymers, more than any other material, offer this possibility to fine-tune their thermal, optical and electrical properties through precise changes to molecular structure. Polymers are also the basis of the nanotechnology revolution, serving as photoresists used to create nanometer scale structures. Our research is therefore focused in three areas: (i) fundamental studies of self-organization in polymers, (ii) lithographic materials for microelectronics and biotechnology and (iii) new environmentally and biologically friendly materials. Each of these topics involves creative polymer synthesis using state-of-the-art facilities and methods as well as advanced characterization tools, most of which are located here at Cornell University.

After receiving a B.S. degree from Caltech, he did graduate work at Stanford University receiving an M.S. in Electrical Engineering and a Ph.D. in Materials Science and Engineering. He was then a post-doc at IBM\u2019s research lab in Zurich, Switzerland in the oxide superconductors and novel materials group managed by Nobel Prize winners J. Georg Bednorz and K. Alex M\u00fcller. In 1992 he joined the faculty at Penn State in the Department of Materials Science and Engineering, where he spent 16 years before joining the faculty at Cornell in 2008. His research interests involve the heteroepitaxial growth and characterization of oxide thin films by reactive molecular-beam epitaxy (MBE), especially utilizing a \u2018materials-by-design\u2019 approach to the discovery of materials with properties superior to any known. His group synthesizes these oxide heterostructures using molecular-beam epitaxy (MBE). He has published over 750 papers and 15 patents resulting in an h-index of 103 and over 55,000 citations. His work has been recognized by the highest awards for materials discovery by five relevant societies: the MRS Medal from the Materials Research Society, the Frank Prize from the International Organization for Crystal Growth, the McGroddy Prize from the American Physical Society, the John A. Thornton Memorial Award/Lecture from the American Vacuum Society, and the John Bardeen award from The Minerals, Metals & Materials Society (TMS). He is a Fellow of the American Physical Society, the Materials Research Society, the American Vacuum Society, and is a member of the National Academy of Engineering.\nSchlom was named the Tisch University Professor in 2023.\nResearch Interests\nThe focus of my group\u2019s research is investigating and perfecting the properties of oxide materials for electronic uses. To do this, we grow oxide thin films on single crystal substrates of closely related substances. The single crystal substrate provides a structural template for the thin films that we grow. The films follow this atomic template and are thus said to be epitaxial (inheriting their crystalline arrangement from the underlying substrate). Our focus on oxides is due to the tremendous promise that these materials hold for electrical applications. Oxides exhibit an unparalleled variety of electronic properties. Insulating, semiconducting, and even superconducting oxides all exist within the set of structurally compatible oxides known as perovskites. This structurally related family also includes oxides that are magnetic, ferroelectric, or even both at the same time. In short, this family of oxides contains the full spectrum of electronic properties. A major challenge, however, is to prepare these materials with sufficient quality and integrate them with adequate control so that these properties can be fully utilized in electronic devices. This is our research goal.\nAdvanced Materials\nEnergy Systems\nMaterials Synthesis and Processing\nNanotechnology\nSemiconductor Physics and Devices\nSensors and Actuators\nSurface Science\nTeaching Interests\nSchlom teaches courses on the properties of electronic materials and the synthesis of thin films.

For the past 28 years, his group\u2019s research has focused on the behavior of semiconductor materials under pulsed and CW laser exposure. He is coauthor on more than 120 papers and over 20 patents.\nResearch Interests\nProfessor Thompson\u2019s group is focused on the use of transient thermal processing on time frames from nanosecond to sub-seconds as a method for characterization and modification of material properties, focusing particularly on semiconductor materials and applications. These timeframes are achieved primarily through the use of pulsed and CW laser sources to heat materials to temperatures far beyond conventional limits, and cool within comparable timeframes by thermal quench to substrates. His group uses these methods to study fundamental material properties such as (i) the limits to liquid-phase epitaxial crystal growth through topologically complex nanopores, (ii) metastable activation and deactivation of dopant impurities in semiconductors, (iii) reaction and diffusion mechanisms in chemically amplified photoresist systems, and (iv) limits to stability of materials (organic) at high temperatures. These studies are tightly coupled with the corresponding industrial challenges including (i) front end junction formation for VLSI, (ii) EUV lithography, (iii) flexible electronics and (iv) novel photonic and solar cell materials.\nAdvanced Materials Processing\nAdvanced Materials\nMaterials Synthesis and Processing\nSemiconductor Physics and Devices\nTeaching Interests\nThe challenge in teaching is helping students realize that they can master a rigorous and challenging course. For almost 25 years, Professor Thompson has been teaching juniors in materials science and engineering the fundamentals of thermodynamics. In an abstract and generally non-intuitive course, Professor Thompson enjoys the continuous challenge of finding real-life examples to motivate the material, and identifying physical analogs that help students gain an intuitive as well as mathematical understanding. Last year, he inherited the introduction to electronic properties course (ENGRD 2620) and is currently working to develop similar examples. He also coordinates the senior thesis course including segments covering professional responsibilities in the lab environment, and statistical analysis and treatment of experimental data. Although time no longer permits, he particularly enjoyed teaching a microelectronic fabrication course giving students a direct experience with the fun of actually making things!\nService Interests\nExternally, Professor Thompson is active as a consultant in the microelectronics industry. Internally, his primary focus tends to migrate toward curriculum development and outreach activities promoting materials science and engineering. He currently serves on the department curriculum review committee, lead the ABET accreditation process in the department, and is on the FABIT committee for the college.\nSelect Publications\nChen, S., X.

He gained his Ph.D. in 1991 in Physical Chemistry with work at the Max-Planck-Institute for Polymer Research (MPI-P), Mainz, Germany, on holographic information storage in polymer liquid crystals. After a two-year postdoc at E.S.P.C.I. in Paris, France, on local dynamics-mechanical property correlations in polyesters, he returned to the MPI-P in 1993 were he finished his Habilitation and received tenure in 1998 with work on block copolymers under oscillatory shear and block copolymer ionomers.\nHe joined the Cornell University, NY, MS&E faculty in 1999 as a tenured Associate Professor, became a Full Professor in 2005, and since 2008 is the Spencer T. Olin Professor of Engineering. Since his arrival at Cornell he has worked at the interface between polymer science and inorganic/solid-state chemistry with the goal to generate multifunctional nanomaterials for applications including energy conversion and storage, clean water, and nanomedicine. Since 2015 he is the co-director of the MSKCC-Cornell Center for Translation of Cancer Nanomedicine (MC2TCN), one of six Centers for Cancer Nanotechnology Excellence (CCNE) funded by the NCI \u2197.\nResearch Interests\nThe goal of current research in the Wiesner group is to combine knowledge about the self-assembly of soft polymeric materials with the functionality of solid-state materials to generate novel hierarchical and multifunctional hybrid materials. Research results of the group on the use of blocked copolymers as structure directing agents for inorganic materials suggest that in analogy to biology, the sequence information of higher order blocked synthetic macromolecular architectures may be used to encode information about hierarchical structure of co-assemblies with ceramic or other materials. These principles may permit the design of entirely new classes of functional materials that have no analogue in the natural world with potential applications ranging from power generation and energy conversion all the way to the life sciences.\nAs a particular model system to understand structure formation principles, silica-based hybrids from block copolymer mesophases have been studied extensively over the last ten years. One of the main working principles involves utilizing the thermodynamics of amphiphilic block copolymers, i.e., knowledge about their self-assembly behavior (bottom-up) to structure direct precursors for silica-type oxides. In the meantime these principles have been extended to other oxides as well as to non-oxide ceramics (e.g., SiCN). Synthesis results in mesostructured hybrid materials with structure control down to the nanometer length scale that upon, e.g., thermal processing can subsequently be converted into purely ceramic materials with preserved structure (e.g., mesoporous materials). The final materials have a broad range of potential applications in, e.g., catalysis and separation.\nA second major current research direction of the Wiesner group focuses on a novel class of fluorescent core-shell silica nanoparticles, now referred to as C-dots, with potential applications, e.g., as fluorescent labels in biolabeling and bioimaging. Water-soluble C- dots encapsulate multiple organic fluorophores into a solid-state silica environment, thereby improving their photophysical properties as compared to the free dye in water. C-dots have narrow size distributions and in the 20-30 nm size range achieve brightness levels reaching those of semiconductor quantum (Q-) dots with simultaneously enhanced photostability over free dye in aqueous solutions. They are synthesized through a modified St\u00f6ber process and overcome toxicity and disposal issues of competing Q-dot technologies. As a result of their optical property profiles they constitute an attractive alternative to existing materials platforms for applications in information technologies and the life sciences requiring bright fluorescent probes. Fundamental studies are aimed at understanding and controlling optical phenomena of this novel class of radiative nanoparticles and of optical structures and devices that integrate them.\nDrug Delivery and Nanomedicine\nPolymers and Soft Matter\nEnergy Systems\nMechanics of Biological Materials\nBiomedical Imaging and Instrumentation\nMaterials Synthesis and Processing\nNanotechnology\nBiomedical Engineering\nTissue Engineering and Biomaterials\nAdvanced Materials\nColloids and Interfacial Science\nMolecular and Cellular Engineering\nResearch Projects\nFormation mechanisms of nanostructured polymer-inorganic hybrid materials from diblock- and triblock-copolymers and nanoparticles.\nMesoporous oxides and non-oxides for power generation and energy conversion.\nNovel dendron derived structure directing agents for functional materials.\nNanostructured block copolymer-silica hybrid thin films.\nSynthesis and characterization of C dots from various organic fluorophores.\nPreparation of multifunctional C dots.\nC dots as labels and probes in bioimaging.\nLocomotive motion in hydrogels from symmetry breaking of gel volume phase transitions\nSelect Publications\nK.

They span fundamental issues related to the origins of colloidal interactions through to the application of chemically tailored interfaces in chemical and biological sensors, biomedical devices and separations processes. His research group has designed and synthesized a range of surfactants that incorporate molecular triggers (redox-active and light-sensitive groups) that permit reversible control of surfactant-based properties of aqueous systems. They are exploring their use in separations processes, solar energy harvesting devices, and for the delivery of biomolecules to cells. His research group is also particularly interested in colloidal forces in liquid crystalline phases, and they have designed liquid crystalline interfaces that permit chemical and biomolecular events to be amplified into easily measured signals in sensors.  A third area of interest is related to hydrophobic interactions mediated by complex patterns of chemical functionality on the nanoscale. This latter topic is leading to new design rules for molecular self-assembly, molecular recognition and adhesion in aqueous environments. These technical interests are unified by the challenge of understanding molecules and their assemblies at interfaces.\nComplex Fluids and Polymers\nNanoscale Electronics, Photonics and Materials Processing\nAdvanced Materials\nAdvanced Materials Processing\nBioengineering\nBiomedical Engineering\nBiomolecular Engineering\nColloids and Interfacial Science\nDrug Delivery and Nanomedicine\nMaterials Synthesis and Processing\nMechanics of Biological Materials\nMicrofluidics\nMicrofluidics and Microsystems\nNanobio Applications\nPolymers and Soft Matter\nNanotechnology\nSensors and Actuators\nSurface Science\nTissue Engineering and Biomaterials\nSustainable Energy Systems\nTeaching Interests\nNicholas Abbott has taught undergraduate classes in thermodynamics, transport phenomena and introductory colloid and interface science.

He completed postdoctoral fellowships in the Orthopaedic Research Laboratory at the Massachusetts General Hospital and in the Center for Biomedical Engineering at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He currently serves on the editorial board of the journal Tissue Engineering.\nDr. Bonassar\u2019s research group focuses on the regeneration and analysis of musculoskeletal tissues, including bone and cartilage. The approach involves a multidisciplinary strategy using techniques in biomechanics, biomaterials, cell biology, and biochemistry. Applications of this technology include the repair of articular cartilage, intervertebral disc, trachea and craniofacial defects.\nAt the cellular level, this work focuses on understanding the interactions of chondrocytes, fibroblasts and stem cells with biomaterials. This includes grafting of cell adhesion peptides to polymers and characterizing the effects of these alterations on the way in which cells sense their environment. Of specific interest is the extent to which intrinsic mechanical properties and externally applied forces control chondrocyte matrix assembly.\nThis work feeds into studies of the generation of biological structures at the tissue level, where cell-biomaterials interactions include understanding the way in which materials processing techniques affect cell behavior. This has led to the development of techniques known as tissue injection molding and cell-mediated sintering, whereby living implants are formed under conditions that support cell viability. Extensions of this work are aimed at fabricating composite tissues with heterogeneous structures and anisotropic properties.\nThe third focus area of the group is understanding structure-property relationships in native and engineered tissues. This involves experimental correlation of tissue mechanical properties with biochemical composition as well as mathematical modeling of tissue assembly processes and structure-property relationships.\nM.Eng. Design Team Spotlight: Meniscus repair with radiofrequency (RF) tissue welding\nDr. Bonassar has been working with M.Eng. Director and a student team, with an industry sponsor to develop a tissue fusion system that uses radiofrequency (RF) energy to repair partial tears of the meniscus. The goal is to provide a minimally invasive and highly effective RF-based treatment for torn meniscus by developing testing protocols and assessing the optimal parameters of RF to maximize the mechanical benefit and minimize cell damage to the meniscus.

He currently serves on the editorial board of the journal Tissue Engineering.\nDr. Bonassar\u2019s research group focuses on the regeneration and analysis of musculoskeletal tissues, including bone and cartilage. The approach involves a multidisciplinary strategy using techniques in biomechanics, biomaterials, cell biology, and biochemistry. Applications of this technology include the repair of articular cartilage, intervertebral disc, trachea and craniofacial defects.\nAt the cellular level, this work focuses on understanding the interactions of chondrocytes, fibroblasts and stem cells with biomaterials. This includes grafting of cell adhesion peptides to polymers and characterizing the effects of these alterations on the way in which cells sense their environment. Of specific interest is the extent to which intrinsic mechanical properties and externally applied forces control chondrocyte matrix assembly.\nThis work feeds into studies of the generation of biological structures at the tissue level, where cell-biomaterials interactions include understanding the way in which materials processing techniques aff"

He served as Director of the School of Applied & Engineering Physics from 2000-2007. At Cornell, he is affiliated with the Cornell Center for Materials Research (CCMR), the Energy Materials Center at Cornell (emc2), and is Director of the Cornell High Energy Synchrotron Source (CHESS).

Brock is a fellow of the American Physical Society.\nResearch Interests\nFor over 100 years, our fundamental understanding of the structure of materials on atomic length scales has been advanced by direct structural measurements using x-rays. Modern synchrotrons provide over 8 orders of magnitude higher fluxes than laboratory based sources. This flux enables us to utilize higher resolution: higher angular resolution for diffraction, higher energy resolution for spectroscopies, higher time resolution for dynamics, and higher spatial resolution for imaging. We employ modern synchrotron-based x-ray techniques to measure the structure directly on length-scales ranging from 1 \u2013 50,000\u00c5 on time scales ranging from 10-6 \u2013 103 seconds. We are currently concentrating our studies on pulsed laser deposition (PLD) of complex oxide thin films.\nThe desire to manufacture devices with characteristic features on (sub)nanometer length scales has driven an enormous effort to create thin films with precisely controlled chemical composition, crystal structure and morphology. Energetic processing techniques offer the enticing prospect of gaining additional control at the nanoscale over thin-film deposition and processing. However, our fundamental understanding of non-thermal growth and surface processing is in an early stage of development. We are studying the fundamental processes governing deposition via Pulsed Laser Deposition (PLD). Empirically, by tuning the substrate temperature, background gas pressure, laser pulse rate, and energy density of the laser pulse, high quality films of many cubic perovskite (e.g., colossal magnetoresistance (CMR), piezoelectric, and high TC superconducting materials) can be grown using PLD. Our time-resolved x-ray structural measurements directly test proposed growth models. This research program is a component of the CCMR\u2019s IRG-3 and is based at CHESS.\nI am also working to develop the next generation of x-ray sources. LINAC based x-ray sources such as (pulsed) X-ray Free Electron Lasers (XFELs) and (cw) Energy Recovery LINACs (ERLs) will create diffraction limited and degenerate x-ray beams that will enable coherent and time-resolved techniques previously only possible with optical lasers. Our long term goal is to generate, manipulate, and utilize coherent x-ray beams for atomic-scale structural measurements on the relevant fundamental time-scales. Discovering and optimizing catalysts for electrochemical energy conversion processes, such as the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), are critical steps on the path towards developing renewable energy production and storage technologies. These two reactions are central to water-splitting, fuel cells, and metal-air batteries. SrTiO3 is the prototype for photo-catalytically active complex-oxide perovskite systems and our research focuses on using x-ray structural techniques to elucidate the (surface) structure-function relationship. Electrochemical studies (in collaboration with the Abru\u00f1a group) complement the x-ray structural studies, demonstrating reaction intermediates and chemical surface coverage.\nAdvanced Materials\nArtificial Intelligence\nNanotechnology\nEnergy and the Environment\nCondensed Matter and Material Physics\nEnergy Systems\nSelect Publications\nQuackenbush, N F., H.

He joined the Cornell faculty in July of 2008 and works in the broad area of computational/theoretical materials physics including Materials-by-Design. He is the recipient of the 2010 Young Investigator Award from the Army Research Office, the 2011 Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) award from the National Science Foundation, and the 2012 Presidential Early Career Award for Scientists and Engineers (PECASE), and the 2013 MacArthur Fellowship. In 2015, Fennie was elected a Fellow of American Physical Society.\nResearch Interests\nOur interests lie at the intersection of Condensed matter/materials physics and solid state chemistry and can be broadly characterized as centered on the use of theory to elucidate the fundamental principles that govern the relationship between the structure and the macroscopic behavior of complex bulk, thin film, and heterostructured materials in which lattice, magnetic, orbital, and/or electronic degrees of freedom are active.\nIn this regard we are particularly interested in understanding how the composition, symmetry, geometry, and topology of crystalline motifs influence the interplay among the active degrees-of-freedom, how this subsequently manifests itself in the macroscopic properties, and if this interplay can be controlled so as to produce \u201cdesigner\u201d properties and functionalities.\nWe are fascinated by systems in which understanding the structural complexity is key to explaining their macroscopic properties and in particular by systems under extreme environments where chemical intuition often breaks down. Our modus operandi combines microscopic Hamiltonians/models with fundamental principles of solid-state chemistry and first-principles simulations.\nToday, first-principles quantum techniques are powerful tools for analyzing and interpreting the properties of crystalline materials, yet the theoretical design of new materials with targeted properties remains challenging. Why? At a somewhat fundamental level, that the laws governing the physics of materials are in fact relatively simple, it is just that the behavior of the constituents as a whole are complex. Indeed, materials are made up of atoms whose type, number, and arrangement \u2013 the crystalline motif \u2013 creates distinct properties that emerge through the collective behavior of the seemingly simpler, well-understood parts. The discovery of emergent phenomena in condensed matter systems is therefore intimately linked with that of discovering the crystalline materials that display these phenomena.\nThis work by its very nature has to cross the border between the traditional disciples of physics and of chemistry, and when successful impacts both fields. As a long-term goal of ours is to develop an ab initio strategy towards materials discovery (sometimes referred to as \u201cmaterials-by-design\u201d), it is my strong belief that it would be quite difficult to make a meaningful and long-lasting impact without engaging both disciplines with the same drive and focus.\nAdvanced Materials Processing\nAdvanced Materials\nCondensed Matter and Material Physics\nSelect Publications\nMundy, J A., C M.

      "research_interests": "Research Interests\nOur interests lie at the intersection of Condensed matter/materials physics and solid state chemistry and can be broadly characterized as centered on the use of theory to elucidate the fundamental principles that govern the relationship between the structure and the macroscopic behavior of complex bulk, thin film, and heterostructured materials in which lattice, magnetic, orbital, and/or electronic degrees of freedom are active.\nIn this regard we are particularly interested in understanding how the composition, symmetry, geometry, and topology of crystalline motifs influence the interplay among the active degrees-of-freedom, how this subsequently manifests itself in the macroscopic properties, and if this interplay can be controlled so as to produce \u201cdesigner\u201d properties and functionalities.\nWe are fascinated by systems in which understanding the structural complexity is key to explaining their macroscopic properties and in particular by systems under extreme environments where chemical intuition often breaks down. Our modus operandi combines microscopic Hamiltonians/models with fundamental principles of solid-state chemistry and first-principles simulations.\nToday, first-principles quantum techniques are powerful tools for analyzing and interpreting the properties of crystalline materials, yet the theoretical design of new materials with targeted properties remains challenging. Why? At a somewhat fundamental level, that the laws governing the physics of materials are in fact relatively simple, it is just that the behavior of the constituents as a whole are complex. Indeed, materials are made up of atoms whose type, number, and arrangement \u2013 the crystalline motif \u2013 creates distinct properties that emerge through the collective behavior of the seemingly simpler, well-understood parts. The discovery of emergent phenomena in condensed matter systems is therefore intimately linked with that of discovering the crystalline materials that display these p",

Afterward, he moved to the University of California, Santa Barbara as a postdoctoral associate. In 2011, he joined the Cornell faculty of Applied and Engineering Physics. In 2012 he received a Young Investigator Award from the Air Force Office of Scientific Research, in 2013 he received an Early Faculty Career Award from the National Science Foundation along with the Presidential Early Career Award for Scientists and Engineers, and in 2014 he received the Early Career Award from the Department of Energy.\nResearch Interests\nThe Fuchs Group focuses on quantum informa\u00adtion science and spintronics. We study and manipulate spin and optical degrees of freedom in solid-state materials. Although we are primarily a condensed matter physics research group, we draw inspiration from many fields including atomic physics, materials science, and electrical engineering.\nWe are interested in hybrid quantum systems, in which disparate degrees of freedom interact coherently. Such systems can form the basis of future quantum technologies such as quantum repeat\u00aders and quantum transducers. Diamond nitrogen-vacancy (NV) defect centers are an important platform for our research because they possess a coherent optical transition, long-lived spin coher\u00adence, and several mechanisms for coupling to external degrees of freedom \u2013 mechanical, magnetic, and electrical. NV center-based hybrid systems form outstanding quantum-enhanced sensors for a range of applications from nanoscience to naviga\u00adtion and they can form the backbone of a quantum network. In addition to diamond NV centers, also examine emerging defect centers in wide band-gap materials for quantum applications.\nIn an emerging research area within the group, we are interested in a hybrid quantum system based on superconducting microwave circuits and ultra-low damping magnetic materials.  We have recently demonstrated the integration of these two disparate elements in a way that allows us to design waveguides microwave photons and magnons on an equal basis, enabling controlled and strong interactions.  We are interested in using these structures for a variety of experiments ranging from the demonstration of nonreciprocal quantum circuit elements to the creation of quantum states of magnons.\nAnother focus is understanding spins and spin dynamics in materials to enable future technologies based on spin. We are interested in spin-orbit torques and exotic spin order including antiferromagnetic, multiferroic, and chiral mag\u00adnetic materials. One important tool in our research is the time-resolved magneto-thermal microscope \u2014 a unique ta\u00adble-top magnetic microscope that we have developed over the past several years. Our approach is surprisingly versatile: we have imaged spin texture in magnetic metals, magnetic insulators, antiferromagnetic metals, and antifer\u00adromagnetic insulators.  In recent years, we have also built a scanning NV center microscope as another versatile tool for studying magnetic materials and devices.  This microscope leverages quantum sensing protocols to acquire images of the NV center\u2019s spin response to magnetic fields and magnetic fluctuations that originate from a sample with ~50 nm resolution.  So far, we have used it to study canted antiferromagnetic materials and devices.\nNanotechnology\nCondensed Matter and Material Physics\nOptical Physics\nQuantum Information Science\nSelect Publications\nI.

He served as Postdoctoral Research Fellow, MIT (2005) Postdoctoral Research Fellow, TU Eindhoven, and The Netherlands (2006-2007) before coming to Cornell.\nResearch Interests\nThere is a tremendous opportunity space for nanostructured materials to play a key role in next generation energy technologies. Our research efforts focus on the fundamental study of optoelectronic properties of semiconductor nanocrystals; this work is inspired by the potential application of these materials in solar energy conversion and energy storage devices. The semiconductor nanocrystals used in our work provide a diverse set of building blocks whose electronic and optical properties differ from their bulk counterparts due to the spatial wavefunction confinement. This quantum confinement effect allows us to engineer the materials properties through simple adjustments in nanocrystal size, shape, composition, and surface chemistry. In addition to their immense potential for technological applications, these materials also provide a material system to experimentally test fundamental quantum mechanical concepts.\nNanotechnology\nAdvanced Materials Processing\nAdvanced Materials\nSurface Science\nSustainable Energy Systems\nNanoscale Electronics, Photonics and Materials Processing\nTeaching Interests\nEducation and outreach are fully integrated with the research activities of our group. Our educational objectives are designed to: (1) integrate results from the research frontier and education of students and (2) capture the students enthusiasm and engagement in impending energy issues, encouraging their future contributions as the next generation of scientist and engineers.

Prior to Cornell he was the Boeing-Roundhill Professor of Engineering in the Department of Chemical Engineering and an adjunct professor of Bioengineering at the University of Washington, Seattle.\nJiang pioneered the molecular understanding, design and development of functional zwitterionic materials. Since the early 2000s, his group has proposed the concept of super-hydrophilic zwitterionic materials, provided a molecular-level understanding of non-fouling mechanisms and developed several new classes of zwitterionic materials, including poly(carboxybetaine), poly(sulfobetaine), poly(trimethylamine N-oxide), poly(zwitterionic phosphatidylserine), and glutamic acid (E) and lysine (K)-containing poly(peptides). His group has demonstrated no capsule formation upon subcutaneous implantation in mice for one year, expansion of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) without differentiation, no anti-coagulants needed for artificial lungs in sheep, no antibodies generated against zwitterionic polymers, and environmentally benign marine coatings. These highly biocompatible zwitterionic materials are excellent alternatives to widely used poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) counterparts as PEG immunogenicity was found in COVID-19 vaccines. He co-founded three companies \u2013 ZWI Therapeutics, Taproot Medical and Imperion Coatings based on over 50 awarded patents on zwitterionic technologies. Largely resulting from his work, zwitterionic materials have been widely adopted for biomedical and engineering applications.\nAt Cornell, his group aims to (a) integrate immunology into his biomaterials and drug delivery research programs; (b) translate his biomaterials and drug delivery technologies into medical and engineering practice. Currently, his group performs both basic and applied research integrating science, engineering and medicine, particularly in two areas: (i) Biomaterials for regenerative and precision medicine: His group is developing highly biocompatible and immunomodulating materials for the controlled culture of iPSCs and cancer organoids along with capsule-free long-term implants and anticoagulant-free blood-contacting devices in vivo. Similar materials have been applied to anti-fouling marine coatings; (ii) Drug delivery for cancer vaccines & neurological diseases: His group is developing low-immunogenic and targeted viral and non-viral carriers for the delivery of mRNAs, DNAs, proteins and small molecules for cancer and infectious disease vaccines along with the treatments of several diseases such as cancer, neurological diseases and diabetes. His group has close collaborations with researchers at Weill Cornell Medicine, Cornell College of Veterinary Medicine, and several other departments at Cornell and beyond.\nResearch Interests\nBiomedical Engineering\nBiomolecular Engineering\nColloids and Interfacial Science\nDrug Delivery and Nanomedicine\nMaterials Design\nMaterials Synthesis and Processing\nMolecular and Cellular Engineering\nMolecular Biotechnology\nNanobio Applications\nNanotechnology\nPolymers and Soft Matter\nStatistical Mechanics and Molecular Simulation\nTissue Engineering and Biomaterials\nTeaching Interests\nBiomaterials\nBiointerfaces\nDrug Delivery and Nanomedicine\nImmunoengineering\nBiomolecular Thermodynamics\nIntroduction to Molecular Modeling and Simulation Methods\nSelect Publications\nQ.

Research areas include crystal stress measurements, microplasticity, fatigue crack initiation, high temperature behavior of superalloys, mechanical behavior of silicon, design and implementation of new in situ experiments with synchrotron x-rays, multiscale model development and validation. Educational areas focus on mechanics of materials, material selection, x-ray diffraction, graduate solid mechanics, mechanics of composites, experimental methods and state variable modeling.\nMatthew Miller joined the Sibley School faculty in January, 1994 and is currently a full Professor. Miller received his B.S. in Mechanical Engineering from the Colorado School of Mines and his M.S. and Ph.D. from Georgia Tech. He was named the 1993 outstanding graduating Ph.D. in mechanical engineering and was inducted into the Georgia Tech. Council of Outstanding Young Engineering Alumni in 1995. Professor Miller spent a sabbatical leave at the Colorado School of Mines in 2000-2001, at the Advanced Photon Source (APS) at Argonne National Laboratory in 2007 and The Ohio State University in 2008. Professor Miller has developed in situ mechanical testing / synchrotron x-ray experiments at the Cornell High Energy Synchrotron Source (CHESS) and at the APS. In 2011, he co-organized a workshop at the APS to explore the synergy between high energy synchrotron x-ray diffraction experiments and high fidelity material behavior models. Miller is currently the Associate Director of CHESS and serves on the Section 1 Beamline Advisory Group at the APS. Professor Miller spent 6 years playing professional football before returning to obtain his engineering degrees. He played 4 years as an offensive lineman for the Cleveland Browns of the NFL and 2 years for the Denver Gold of the USFL.\nProfessor Miller has received several teaching and advising awards at Cornell. He was a Lilly Teaching Fellow in 1995, he won the Dennis Shepherd Award as the Outstanding Teacher in the Sibley School in 1996. Miller won the James and Mary Tien Excellence in Teaching Award in 2004 and the James M. Marsha D. McCormick Award for Excellence in Advising First Year Students in 2006 \u2013 both awarded by the Cornell College of Engineering. Professor Miller won an NSF CAREER Award in 1997 and participated in the National Academy of Engineering Frontiers of Engineering in 1999. He won the ASM International Henry Marion Howe Award in 2009 for the Best Research Paper in Metallurgical and Materials Transactions in 2008. Professor Miller is on the Editorial Advisory Board of the International Journal of Fatigue and is on the Review Board for Integrating Materials and Manufacturing Innovation. In 2022, he was elected the Willis H. Carrier Professor in Engineering.\nResearch Interests\nMiller\u2019s research focuses on the creation of tools that enable the design and selection of structural materials. Much of Miller\u2019s work is at the experiment/model interface, where he and his students have designed experiments to probe material state and behaviors on multiple size scales. An emphasis is the use of synchrotron x-rays and in-situ mechanical loading to understand the crystal level mechanical state of alloys during deformation \u2013 including monotonic loading and fatigue. Results from these experiments \u2013 which have been conducted on copper, aluminum, beryllium and titanium alloys \u2013 are enabling improved understanding of how micromechanical stress states evolve during plastic deformation and, eventually how damage such as a fatigue crack initiates. Miller is the Director of the new Insit\u03bc (Integrated Simulation and x-ray Interrogation Tools and training for micromechanics) center at CHESS. The focus of Insit\u03bc is on developing experimental capabilities and nurturing new users in the general area of structural materials. Specific support for industrial users at Insit\u03bc comes from a recent grant from the Office of Naval Research.\nMaterials Synthesis and Processing\nComputational Mechanics\nComputational Solid Mechanics\nSolid Mechanics\nMaterials Design\nAdvanced Manufacturing and Materials\nTeaching Interests\nMiller has developed and taught undergraduate and graduate courses focusing on engineering materials at Cornell in M&AE. The required sophomore course that Miller has developed, M&AE212, begins with basic mechanics of materials concepts then introduces failure analyses associated with yielding, fracture and fatigue. The course culminates with fundamentals of material selection employing the concept of material indices. Recently Miller developed a senior level composites course that contains a senior design element. On the graduate level, Miller has taught the theory and implementation of state variable plasticity models as well as an experimental-mechanics based course focused on the model-experiment interface. A new graduate course focuses on synchrotron x-ray diffraction and the measurement of lattice strains. This course culminates with students conducting experiments CHESS.\nSelect Publications\nMiller, Matthew Peter, P. R.

As a scientist at Bell Labs, he applied his research on imaging single atoms and atomic-scale spectroscopy to determine the physical limits on how small a transistor can be made. His work more generally has focused on the development of scanning transmission electron microscopy and spectroscopy as quantitative tools for atomic-resolution materials analysis, and its application to unraveling connections between electronic-structure changes on the atomic scale and the macroscopic behavior of materials. This includes systems as diverse as fuel cells, batteries, turbine blades, and two-dimensional superconductors.\nDavid is a fellow of both the American Physical Society and the Microscopy Society of America, and recipient of the DGE\u2019s Ernst Ruska Prize, the MSA Burton Medal and MAS Duncumb Award.\nResearch Interests\nMy group\u2019s research at Cornell University is focused on understanding the behavior of materials and devices at the atomic scale, with an emphasis on renewable energy applications. Using some of the most powerful electron microscopes in the world, placed in specially-designed and environmentally isolated rooms, we are able to explore the chemistry, electronic structure and bonding inside objects as diverse as transistors, turbine blades, two-dimensional superconductors, fuel cells and batteries. All of these systems are made up of different materials, and where they join at the atomic scale, the boundary conditions on the quantum mechanical wavefunctions force very different behavior from what might be expected of the bulk materials. At these boundaries, where everyday intuition breaks down, we are searching for new and unexpected phases and physics. The impact of this research on devices, both larger and small, could be very significant.\nWe are interested in students who enjoy both physics theory and experiment, can think in both real and reciprocal space, and care about both why things are, and what they might be used for. Openings are likely in the area of atomically-engineered materials for energy generation, conversion and storage, and studies of two-dimensional materials and electronic phases in complex oxides.

This includes systems as diverse as fuel cells, batteries, turbine blades, and two-dimensional superconductors.\nDavid is a fellow of both the American Physical Society and the Microscopy Society of America, and recipient of the DGE\u2019s Ernst Ruska Prize, the MSA Burton Medal and MAS Duncu"

(2002) and Ph.D. (2010) in Material Science at the University of Illinois where his research focused on developing polymeric and colloidal suspensions as \u2018inks\u2019 for 3D printers. He also fabricated microfluidic devices to synthesize single micron to millimeter scale parts (e.g., glass and silicon microgears). Concurrently to performing this research, he received his M.B.A. (2009) at U of I and started a company, worked with several other startups, and gained significant experience with the details of market research, financials, accounting issues, and legal aspects of entrepreneurship. In 2010, he continued his education as a post-doctoral fellow at Harvard University in George Whitesides\u2019s research group in the Department of Chemistry and Chemical Biology. In this group, he developed pneumatic actuators in soft elastomers that took the form of a machine capable of moving in multiple gaits: walking and undulating. These actuators have also been used for low-cost manipulators, and in concert with a microfluidic system for biomimetic camouflage & display.\nResearch Interests\nDr. Shepherd is interested in developing disruptive manufacturing technologies (e.g., 3D printing, replica molding, microfluidics, etc.) and functional materials to enable new devices and user experiences. He is particularly interested in simultaneously increasing the speed, dimensionality, resolution, and materials capability of free-form fabrication techniques, and developing soft actuators that mimic biological functions, but not necessarily their mechanisms: These interests are synergistic and will, perhaps, enable more efficient and life-like machines.\nRobotics and Autonomy\nMaterials Design\nAdvanced Manufacturing and Materials\nTeaching Interests\nDesign and Manufacturing.\nSelect Publications\nMorin, S A., Robert Shepherd, S.

We are pushing and defining the frontier of operando electrochemical liquid-cell scanning transmission electron microscopy (EC-STEM), equipped with four-dimensional (4D) STEM, to interrogate dynamic structural evolution of electrocatalysts at the atomic scale. Our group is now open for recruiting graduate/undergraduate students and postdoctoral/visiting fellows.\nFor inquiries, you can reach out via yaoyang@cornell.edu\nResearch Focus\nElectrochemistry lies at the interface of chemistry and energy materials and represents one of the most promising approaches for enhancing energy efficiency, mitigating environmental impacts and carbon emissions, and enabling renewable energy technologies. Our research focuses on the fundamental understanding of electrochemical mechanisms at interfaces with an emphasis on CO2 reduction, clean H2 production and rechargeable batteries. The central scheme of the Yang group lies in developing operando methods, based on advanced electron microscopy facilities at Cornell Center for Materials Research (CCMR) and synchrotron X-ray methods at Cornell High Energy Synchrotron Source (CHESS), to investigate fundamental aspects of solid-liquid interfaces related to renewable energy technologies:\nOperando electrochemistry at well-defined nanocrystal electrocatalyst/electrolyte interfaces:\nShape-controlled nanocrystals (1-100 nm) exclusively/selectively expose certain facets that can enable tunable catalyst activity/selectivity. They can bridge the knowledge gap between bulk single-crystal electrodes in the electrochemistry community and practical nanoparticles in the materials science community. While there are numerous studies on the synthesis of shape-controlled nanocrystals and characterization of their pristine structures, few studies have attempted to investigate how they activate and/or evolve/deactivate under electrochemical conditions. The project focuses on the design and colloidal synthesis of size- and shape-controlled 0D and 1D metal and oxide nanocrystals and their assembly into 2D and 3D periodic architectures as model systems for operando mechanistic studies. Fundamental insights gained from these studies will enable the rational design of high-performance CO2 reduction electrocatalysts with tunable selectivity and activity.\nFundamental electrochemistry at single-crystal electrode/electrolyte interfaces\nSingle-crystal metals and oxides provide an ideal materials platform with atomic-level control of surface structure/composition to reveal the structure-(re)activity relationships/correlations of electrocatalysts. This project takes advantage of the design and fabrication of well-defined single-crystal metal electrodes by the Clavilier method (Cornell is one of the few places in the world with such a capability.) and single-crystal oxide superlattices by molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) at the NSF supported PARADIM (Platform for the Accelerated Realization, Analysis, and Discovery of Interface Materials) Facility. Single-crystal metals and oxides will serve as well-defined electrode surfaces, which can provide an accurate description of the structure of surface adsorbates for theoretical simulations and guide the design of efficient high performing electrocatalysts for H2 production.\nVisualizing the electrochemical double layer at solid-liquid interfaces at atomic scale\nThe electrochemical double layer (EDL) is one of the \u201cGrand Challenges/Holy Grails\u201d of physical chemistry that has attracted generations of electrochemists. Resolving/visualizing the EDL is key to advancing our fundamental understanding of interfacial electrocatalysis, electron transfer as well as ionic and potential gradients at charged interfaces. The project focuses on developing operando electron microscopy and synchrotron X-ray methods to provide experimental mapping of the EDL. An important example is the formation of the solid-electrolyte interphase (SEI), which determines the cycle life, charge rate and safety of lithium metal or ion based batteries.\nAwards and Honors\n2025 ACS Materials and Interfaces Outstanding Presentations by Young Investigators Award\n2024 Journal of Materials Research (JMR) Distinguished Invited Speaker at MRS Spring\n2021-2024 Miller Postdoctoral Fellowship at UC Berkeley\n2023 Best Early Career Presentation at MRS Spring 2023 (Symposium CH01)\n2022 ACS AC/DC Rising Stars in Analytical Chemistry                            \n2020 Wentink Award   \n2020 Cornell High-Energy Synchrotron Source (CHESS) Student Research Award\n2019 Microscopy Society of America (MSA) Student Poster Award             \n2018 Howard Neal Wachter Memorial Prize \n \nIn the News:\nMoving pictures: Researchers use movies to diagnose EV battery failure\n2030 Project Fast Grant awards support energy systems of the future\nKavli Foundation Nanoscience Profile of Dr. Yao Yang.

He then moved to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where he pioneered the field of artificial ferroelectrics based on van der Waals heterostructures. He joined the School of Applied and Engineering Physics at Cornell as an assistant professor in  2024. The Yasuda lab aims to design quantum nanomaterials and heterostructures to explore novel physical properties and functionalities.\nResearch Interests\nOur research lies at the intersection of condensed matter physics, nanotechnology, and quantum science. We are driven by the goal of creating novel quantum nanomaterials and functionalities through artificial heterostructure synthesis based on 2D materials. We are keen on engineering nontrivial topology and Berry curvature, investigating symmetry-broken states including unconventional ferroelectricity and magnetism, and designing strongly-correlated electronic systems that manifest exotic superconductivity. Details of the topics follow below:\nRational Design of Quantum Nanomaterials\nThe advent of van der Waals heterostructures and moir\u00e9 superlattices has opened a pathway for rational design of artificial quantum materials. Our primary focus is on atomic-scale symmetry engineering, aiming to create symmetry-broken and strongly-correlated electronic states, which we characterize through low-temperature electrical transport and thermodynamic measurements. We intend to translate this physical assembly approach to underexplored 2D materials and free-standing thin films to create innovative nanomaterials.\nNanoscale Imaging and Manipulation\nWe employ various scanning probe microscopy techniques to visualize and manipulate the physical properties of materials, including moir\u00e9 superlattices, chemical potential, ferroelectricity, and magnetism. We are also interested in developing a unique imaging tool that allows us to extract both real-space and momentum-space information about electronic systems.\nFunctional Devices and Application\nIntegrating quantum materials into devices enables functionalities that surpass the limitations of traditional semiconductors. Leveraging our expertise in nanomaterials synthesis and nanofabrication, we aim to prototype proof-of-concept devices for non-volatile information storage, neuromorphic computation, and quantum information processing.\nCondensed Matter and Material Physics\nNanotechnology\nSemiconductor Physics and Devices\nAdvanced Materials\nEnergy Systems\nSelect Publications\nK.

She joined Cornell University in 2024 after co-founding the School of Universal Computing, Construction and Engineering Education at Florida International University (FIU). As an assistant professor at FIU, she co-developed two degree programs, a Ph.D. in Engineering and Computing Education and a B.S. in Interdisciplinary Engineering. In addition, she held appointments in the STEM Transformation Institute, the Department of Mechanical and Materials Engineering, and the Department of Teaching and Learning.\nStrong completed her doctorate in aerospace engineering at Georgia Tech in 2014. While a doctoral student, Strong was a National Science Foundation graduate research fellow and a member of the Cognitive Engineering Center. The goal of her doctorate research was to improve students\u2019 abilities to think more broadly about complex systems design and to take into account stakeholder-related considerations within their design projects. Prior to attending Georgia Tech, Strong received a bachelor\u2019s degree in aerospace engineering from MIT (2007) and a master\u2019s degree in systems engineering from the University of Virginia (2010). For her master\u2019s degree work, she developed a mixed methods research design to examine undergraduate engineering students\u2019 prior knowledge about interdisciplinary approaches to design and problem-solving. Strong continued her educational and professional journey as a postdoctoral fellow at Georgia Tech\u2019s Center for the Enhancement of Teaching and Learning and a faculty member at Olin College of Engineering in Massachusetts (2015-2018).\nGrounded in the growing complexity of ongoing global challenges, Strong\u2019s research focuses on identifying and developing approaches to (a) sustainable change with the systems we inhabit and interact with and (b) how we, as educators, can prepare the next generation of engineers and change agents to develop solutions to these challenges. In recognition of her research accomplishments and future vision, Strong earned an NSF CAREER Award in 2023 to identify, learn from, and amplify the stories of educators who have developed transformational curricular designs while facing barriers that have impeded change in other contexts. Within the field of engineering education, she was appointed to the the American Society for Engineering Education\u2019s (ASEE) Presidential Task Force on Graduate Education (2019 \u2013 2021) and elected to serve as a Director of ASEE\u2019s Educational Research and Methods (ERM) Division (2016-2018). She currently serves as an Associate Editor for Studies in Engineering Education (2020-Present).\nResearch Interests\nTogether, with a diverse group of emerging scholars, we established the Research on Engineering, Design, and Educational Systems (REDES) team. As a team, we aim to create inclusive and equitable educational and work systems by examining critical structures and transition points within engineering education and engineering practice. Towards this aim, we have conducted a diverse array of projects, including but not limited to\nexploring student and faculty experiences in undergraduate engineering courses (e.g., Statics, Capstone Design),\nstudying how practicing engineers engage in cross-disciplinary communication and collaboration,\nexamining the perceptions and experiences of graduate program directors and graduate students in engineering,\namplifying the voices of engineering instructional faculty as they seek to positively impact engineering education, and\ninvestigating student and faculty experiences at Hispanic-Serving Institutions.\nEngineering education\nComplex systems, network science and computation\nTeaching Interests\nStrong has extensive experience teaching design and systems analysis courses at the undergraduate-level (e.g., human-centered design, educational systems design, modeling and simulation, quantitative engineering analysis, senior design). At the graduate-level, her teaching has focused on education research methods and pedagogy.\nSelect Publications\nBracho Perez, V. and Coso Strong, A.

She leads a research group of biomolecular engineers working to understand cell membrane functions and the biological processes that happen within them. Her group pioneered the use of \u201ccell-free\u201d biomembrane platforms for re-creating cellular processes on chip. Much of the work they do has impact in human health or advancing biotechnologies for the good of humankind.\nFor example, her group examines the interactions of biological \u201cpathogenic\u201d nanoparticles, including viruses, bacterial outer membrane vesicles, and oncogenic extracellular vesicles, with cell membrane surfaces. This work has elucidated how these interactions lead to specific biological outcomes like virus infection and disease, biofilm development, and new tissue growth. Her group\u2019s recent work leverages biomembrane chips for synthetic cellular biomanufacturing in \u201corganelles-on-a-chip\u201d to produce therapeutic biomolecules. And more recently, her group has embarked on studies of plant cell membranes, motivated by the impact of climate change on the ability of plants to adapt. Susan has published her work in top journals including Science, the Proceedings of the National Academies of Science, and Advanced Materials. Susan and her group\u2019s research has garnered a number of scientific recognitions. She is the recipient of a National Science Foundation CAREER award in 2011, the Schwartz Life Sciences award in 2016, and in 2017, Susan was honored with the College of Engineering\u2019s Research Excellence Award. Four of her current students received National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowships, several have been honored with prestigious Sloan Fellowships, and others have been selected to participate in esteemed NIH-funded training grants.\nSusan believes that greater access to education for all people leads to more diverse perspectives and greater creativity, which are essential to pursue her research topics. She is committed to the promotion of inclusive and empowering environments in all aspects of education, but especially the STEM fields. Susan has served as the Director of Graduate Studies in her department from 2016-2019. During her tenure in that role she developed and implemented new recruiting practices for graduate students, taking the bold position that she could meet demographic parity and still maintain graduate student quality. These practices have translated to the most diverse classes CBE has had in its history with high water marks of 65% women in the 2019 entering PhD class and 40% underrepresented students in the 2018 entering PhD class, both marks well above the national average. 2018 also brought students from 10 countries.\nSusan has served as the faculty advisor for the Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering Graduate Women\u2019s Group (CBE Women) from 2008-2020. This group provides professional development and leadership opportunities to graduate students to complement their technical graduate education. In 2018, she founded a Diversity and Inclusion Program within her department to educate and inform members about inclusive practices and to build an enriching environment for all \u2013 from the classroom to the lab \u2013 to help all students succeed and reach their potential. Susan has been honored for her commitment to increasing access to education for all students with the Denice Denton Emerging Leader Award in 2012, the Zellman Warhaft Commitment to Diversity Award in 2014, the Alice H. Cook award in 2015. She was also selected to the shortlist of the 2016 international GEDC Airbus Diversity Award for her work advising the outreach program, (called WOMEN), for 10th grade girls and their families from rural upstate communities.\nSusan serves as the faculty-in-residence for Balch Hall: the all-women, freshmen residence hall. In this role she provides educational programming and intellectual engagement activities for a hall of 445 women. Among her favorite offerings is a \u201cLearning Where You Live\u201d course she teaches on women\u2019s leadership and empowerment. Balch Hall counts Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg among its alumnae and Susan considers it an honor to lead Balch now and positively influence today\u2019s young women to set their sights high and aspire to impactful life pursuits, perhaps inspiring tomorrow\u2019s Supreme Court justice, leading tech entrepreneur, or president!\nSusan holds a BS, MS and PhD from Lehigh University and conducted her post-doctoral work at Texas A&M University in the Department of Chemistry. She considers it an honor to share authorship with Nobel Laureate Professor Pierre de Gennes on one of her early publications in graduate school, which set her onto the pathway of becoming an academic professor.\nIn Susan\u2019s free time she enjoys getting back to nature and hiking. She has completed 200 miles of GR5 trail through the French Alps, has hiked through the wilds of Montana and seen grizzly bear and moose at close range, and enjoys climbing the mountains of the high peak area in the Adirondack Park in her home state of New York.\nResearch Interests\nColloids and Interfacial Science\nMolecular Biotechnology\nFluid Dynamics and Rheology\nPolymers and Soft Matter\nNanobio Applications\nBiomedical Engineering\nBioengineering\nBiomedical Imaging and Instrumentation\nMicrofluidics\nMolecular and Cellular Engineering\nDrug Delivery and Nanomedicine\nTissue Engineering and Biomaterials\nBiomolecular Engineering\nCOVID-19 Related Research\nTeaching Interests\nDr. Daniel has taught the following courses:\nENGDR 2190: Mass and Energy Balances, a sophomore-level core class\nCHEME 4320: Unit Operations Laboratory, a senior-level core class\nCHEME 7130: Physical and Chemical Kinetics, a graduate-level core class\nCHEME 7920: Principles and Practices of Graduate Research, a graduate-level seminar class\nSelect Publications\nLiu, H.Y., Pappa, A.M., Pavia, A., Pitsalidis, C., Thiburce, Q., Salleo, A., Owens, R.M.* and S.

DeLisa joined the Department of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering at Cornell University as an assistant professor in 2003. He was promoted to associate professor in 2009 and to professor in 2013, at which time he was named the William L. Lewis Professor of Engineering. He also recently served as a Gastprofessur at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (ETH Z\u00fcrich) in the Institut f\u00fcr Mikrobiologie.\nProfessor DeLisa\u2019s research focuses on understanding and controlling the molecular mechanisms underlying protein biogenesis \u2014 folding and assembly, membrane translocation and post-translational modifications \u2014 in the complex environment of a living cell. His contributions to science and engineering include the invention of numerous commercially important technologies for facilitating the discovery, design and manufacturing of human drugs and seminal discoveries in the areas of cellular protein folding and protein translocation. DeLisa has received several awards for his work including an NSF CAREER award (2005), a NYSTAR Watson Young Investigator award (2004), a Beckman Foundation Young Investigator award (2005), an Office of Naval Research Young Investigator award (2006), and a NYSTAR Distinguished Faculty Award (2007), the inaugural Wiley-Blackwell Biotechnology and Bioengineering Daniel I.C. Wang award (2008), a Cornell Provost\u2019s Award for Distinguished Scholarship (2009), the American Chemical Society BIOT division Young Investigator award (2010), and the Biochemical Engineering Journal Young Investigator award (2013). He was also named one of the top 35 young innovators (TR35) by MIT\u2019s Technology Review (2005), was selected as the Allan P. Colburn Memorial Lecturer at the University of Delaware (2009), and was chosen to deliver the Keynote Lecture at the SIMB RAFT X Meeting (2013). Most recently, he was named the AIChE Division 15C Plenary Award Lecturer (2013), was selected to the IDA/DARPA Defense Science Study Group (2014-15), and was elected as a fellow of the American Institute for Medical and Biological Engineering (2014).\nResearch Interests\nIt has been suggested that life depends on 200-300 core biological processes, the vast majority of which are accomplished by large heterogeneous protein assemblies commonly referred to as machines. Unfortunately, the functional details of many cellular machines have yet to be described for lack of effective tools. In turn, this has hindered our ability to harness nature\u2019s machines for tackling problems that cannot be solved with natural systems. The DeLisa laboratory is working to address this need by bridging fundamental biological and chemical concepts with new tools for interrogating and manipulating biological machinery directly in living cells. A major goal of the DeLisa group is to engineer the protein machinery of simple bacteria for solving complex problems in biology and medicine. They focus on the molecular machines of protein biosynthesis as both a target for understanding and reprogramming cellular function and as a toolbox for the creation of therapeutically and industrially relevant molecules. Their unique approach involves probing and exploiting the function and specificity of cellular protein machinery by integrating protein engineering \u2013 the science of redesigning natural biomolecular scaffolds \u2013 with microbial genetics, biochemistry and molecular biology to address these problems. The end result is a deep understanding of the complexities of intracellular protein machinery that can ultimately be used to inform the engineering of cellular processes for the purpose of discovery, design and production of a diverse array of useful products and processes.\nMolecular and Cellular Engineering\nMolecular Biotechnology\nBiomedical Engineering\nBiotechnology\nDrug Delivery and Nanomedicine\nSystems and Synthetic Biology\nBiomolecular Engineering\nBioengineering\nTeaching Interests\nDeLisa\u2019s contributions to teaching have focused on two concepts. First, to enrich the current chemical engineering curriculum by seamlessly integrating biology as a foundational science of our discipline. Second, to develop group-oriented learning experiences that expose students to engineering design, open-ended problem solving and, whenever possible, hands-on research.

She graduated from Clemson University with a B.S. in Chemical Engineering in 2011 and a Ph.D. in Engineering and Science Education in 2014. She joined the School of Engineering Education at Purdue University upon graduation, receiving tenure as well as a joint appointment in the Davidson School of Chemical Engineering in 2020. Her research focuses on four main areas including 1) research on how diverse students in engineering navigate their pathways into and through engineering, with a particular focus on engineering identity development; 2) effective pedagogies and practices for an inclusive engineering education; 3) engineering workforce development; and 4) building capacity for engineering education research, particularly in chemical engineering. Her research earned a National Science Foundation CAREER Award in 2016 focused on characterizing latent diversity, which includes diverse attitudes, mindsets, and approaches to learning to understand engineering students\u2019 identity development. She is the Past Chair of the American Society for Engineering Education Educational Research (ASEE ERM) and Methods Division (2021-2023) and an Associate Editor for Chemical Engineering Education (2020-Present) and the Journal of Engineering Education (2023-Present). Her research has won numerous best paper awards including the 2023 American Institute of Chemical Engineers Award for Excellence in Engineering Education Research Award, the 2022 American Educational Research Association Education in the Professions (Division I) 2021-2022 Outstanding Research Publication Award, and the 2021 Chemical Engineering Education William H. Corcoran Award. She is also an award-winning teacher and graduate mentor.\nResearch Interests\nAllison Godwin\u2019s research focuses on changing the culture of engineering through research to make the discipline more inclusive of all types of people from K-12 through higher education and into engineering industry. She investigates how diverse people develop identities as engineers and how their multiple identities\u2014including gender, race/ethnicity, among others\u2014impact their inclusion, recruitment, persistence, and career trajectories. Identity in a particular role, like engineering, emphasizes that how students make sense of what it means to be a professional within their field can reveal information about how they understand who they are in the world, whom they can become, and if they belong.\nShe conducts mixed methods research, which includes large-scale quantitative studies and \u201csmall n\u201d qualitative studies through surveys, interventions, interviews, focus groups, and other data collection techniques. Using both of these data streams provides the ability to understand general trends as well as rich and nuanced findings from individual\u2019s lived experiences.\nProfessor Godwin has developed and tested effective pedagogies in an introductory chemical engineering course to reduce high failure rates and strengthen students\u2019 motivation. This work has had direct impact on student retention and success rates at Purdue University. She is studying how low-cost, low-effort classroom interventions can address equity gaps in academic performance in first and second-year engineering courses. Professor Godwin has also worked with emerging engineering education scholars to promote engineering education development in methods, publications, and CAREER grant applications.\nEngineering Education\nTeaching Interests\nEngineering requires students to apply fundamental concepts and theories learned not only in their discipline-specific courses but also from other areas. One of Professor Godwin\u2019s key goals for students is that they develop skills in analytical reasoning and transfer of knowledge from familiar contexts to novel problems. She uses evidence-based teaching techniques to support students in this process including active learning, belonging-centered instruction, and others. She has taught large-enrollment first-year engineering courses, materials and energy balances, and graduate courses in engineering education research methods and advanced quantitative methods.\nSelect Publications\nGodwin, A., Potvin G., Hazari, Z. & Lock, R.

She investigates how diverse people develop identities as engineers and how their multiple identities\u2014including gender, race/ethnicity, among others\u2014impact their inclusion, recruitment, persistence, and career trajectories. Identity in a particular role, like engineering, emphasizes that how students make sense of what it means to be a professional within their field can reveal information about how they understand who they are in the world, whom they can become, and if they belong.\nShe conducts mixed methods research, which includes large-scale quantitative studies and \u201csmall n\u201d qualitative studies through surveys, interventions, interviews, focus groups, and other data collection techniques. Using both of these data streams provides the ability to understand general trends as well as rich and nuanced findings from individual\u2019s lived experiences.\nProfessor Godwin has developed and tested effective pedagogies in an introductory chemical engineering course to reduce high failure rates and strengthen students\u2019 motivation.

Work spans fundamental science, where we leverage the unique properties of pseudo-equilibrium states to tune hydrothermal biofuels all the way to large-scale industry collaborations to scale up pyrolysis biofuel production. This work has led to new concepts for the integrated biorefinery, novel carbon-based electrodes and sustainable materials for water treatment applications.\nDr. is an Associate Professor of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering at Cornell University. She received her Ph.D. from Brown University in Chemical Engineering in 2008 and B.S. in Chemical Engineering from Northeastern University in 2004. Research in the Goldfarb group tackles critical \u201clast mile\u201d issues surrounding renewable fuel production from in situ catalysis during thermochemical conversion of biomass to byproduct valorization and technology-policy integration. Work spans fundamental science all the way to large-scale industry collaborations to scale up pyrolysis biofuel production. Her novel concepts for the integrated biorefinery go beyond converting biomass to biofuels. They also produce their own biofuel upgrading and pollution prevention materials by utilizing carbonaceous and heterogeneous organic-inorganic residues remaining after thermochemical conversions.\nHer NSF CAREER Award pushed her biorefinery work into the area of Hydrothermal Liquefaction (HTL). One of the advantages of HTL over other biomass conversion techniques is the direct treatment of wet wastes without an energy-intensive pre-drying step. To date, the majority of HTL research explores the impact of process conditions on products produced from a range of feedstocks. However, this approach cannot overcome the primary challenges to widespread application of HTL for biofuels, namely that (1) we cannot accurately control or predict product distributions, which subsequently requires significant downstream upgrading of the biocrude, and (2) the resulting process water requires considerable treatment, making large scale HTL economically infeasible. Controlling hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) requires us to treat it not as a series of reactions, but rather as a reactive process by which we form supersaturated solutions of aqueous-organic mixtures and a separate organic biocrude. Taking a fundamental thermodynamic approach to HTL and product recovery could accelerate our transition to a renewable energy future by facilitating the design of more efficient and selective HTL processes.\nBeyond the biorefinery, Prof. Goldfarb tackles the design of sustainable materials for water treatment and other environmental applications using computational modeling integrated with experimental fabrication and characterization. She and her collaborators developed and validated a new framework on heterogeneous hierarchical porous media for point-of-use water treatment. Using greener fabrication methods (solvent recycling loops, bio-templating and low-temperature processes) we are designing polymer foam scaffolds with high light penetration and water permeability into which we embed photocatalytically active nanocomposites for the destruction of organic pollutants in water.\nProf. Goldfarb is committed to furthering scientists\u2019 efforts toward public communication and research translation. Outside of the lab, she studies the public\u2019s understanding and willingness to adopt sustainable energy solutions and explores the factors that increase or decrease the public\u2019s willingness to accept a given technology, a critical component driving policy-making. Her work on public understanding of COVID-19 vaccination has been published in the New England Journal of Medicine, and was discussed by Dr. Fauci at a White House Press Briefing.\nProf. Goldfarb\u2019s strong commitment to pedagogical innovation has led to the publication of multiple peer-reviewed articles on new classroom and laboratory activities to engage students in sustainable materials for environmental applications. Outside of the classroom, Prof. Goldfarb has a keen interest in engineering assessment. She translated her knowledge into practice as the co-chair of the Cornell College of Engineering Assessment Committee, and Lead of the 2022 ABET Review Cycle Assessment Reform. Under her leadership, all COE programs were reaccredited during the 2022-2023 visit cycle, and we have laid a foundation of continuing improvement that continues.\nProf Goldfarb holds multiple leadership roles in the profession where she facilitates trans- and interdisciplinary collaborations around environmental, energy and sustainability topics, creates opportunities to showcase researchers from around the world, and seeks to shape science policy. She served as Fall National Meeting Program Chair of the Division of Environmental Chemistry (ENVR) of the American Chemical Society for four years, is currently a Councilor for the Division, and is serving a second term as a member of the ACS Committee on Environmental Improvement. She co-chaired the 2021 ACS Green Chemistry and Engineering Conference and was co-chair of the 2022 Fall National ACS Meeting. Prof. Goldfarb is an outspoken advocate for women in science and engineering and actively engages aspiring graduate students from under-represented groups through her LinkedIn presence. Prof. Goldfarb is Principal Editor (Americas) of the journal Fuel. She is recipient of a 2022 National Science Foundation CAREER Award, a 2019 IUPAC Young Observer Award, 2017 ACS Green Chemistry Institute GreenX: Rising Star Award and was a 2017 Fulbright Scholar in Italy.

Within theParamyxoviridaefamily, Nipah virus (NiV) and Hendra virus (HeV) cause the highest mortality rates (40-100%) in humans. This viral family includes important human and veterinary pathogens, such as measles, mumps, human parainfluenza, canine distemper, and Newcastle disease viruses. There are many questions regarding paramyxoviral infections that remain elusive. Our recent studies identified several novel domains in the viral glycoproteins G and F that are important for modulating the viral-cell membrane fusion process during viral entry, as well as cell-cell fusion upon viral infection of a host cell. We aim to understand the steps in the viral entry process these glycoprotein domains modulate. We use novel approaches that allow us to study the steps of viral entry, such as receptor binding, fusion triggering, hemifusion, fusion pore formation, and syncytia formation on cells and on virions. Novel approaches include Flow Virometry and Raman Spectroscopy. Coronaviral entry into host cells is also of high interest.\nViral egress. Using multi-omics approaches, we recently identified cellular factors involved in viral entry, assembly, and budding out of infected cells. We are using this knowledge to study the mechanisms by which viral and cellular factors interact to modulate viral assembly and egress from infected host cells. Importantly, we connect this knowledge to the study of viral pathogenesis via BSL-3 and established biosafety level 4 collaborations.\nImmune responses and vaccine development. Viral-like particles are non-replication-competent units that resemble the respective actual viruses. Our data has shown that NiV and HeV viral-like particles are useful to generate highly-neutralizing conformational antibodies to NiV and HeV. We investigate whether NiV and HeV viral-like particles and pseudotyped viral particles can be useful vaccine platforms to protect against NiV, HeV, and other emerging paramyxoviruses and other enveloped viruses such as the coronaviruses and influenza viruses. We investigate broadly applicable new technologies to advance vaccine development.\nAntivirals. We take both empirical and targeted approaches. Our main interests include the search for antiviral agents with broad antiviral applications, with a special interest in those to be used against enveloped viruses. Our membrane fusion studies foster the discovery of broad-spectrum antivirals that target enveloped viruses or their host cellular factors. We characterize the mechanisms of action of several families of broad-spectrum antiviral compounds.\nEducation\nBS Biochemical Engineering | Institito Tecnologico de Tepic\nMS Biology | California State University, Los Angeles\nPhD Biochemistry and Mol.

His teaching and research interests lie at the intersection of organic and materials chemistry. The primary research interests include the development of new methods for organic synthesis and identifying new chemistries for separations, which currently account for 15% of global energy use. \nResearch Focus\nAt the crossroads of organic and materials chemistry, the Milner group harnesses the power of framework materials to unlock new possibilities in catalysis and chemical separations. His group designs heterogeneous reagents and catalysts for the late-stage functionalization of bioactive molecules, opening new doors in drug development. The Milner group also develops novel strategies to safely handle gases as solid reagents, with applications in pharmaceutical synthesis and therapeutic delivery. Employing their intuition as organic chemists, the Milner group develops new reactivity-based chemical separations, which are critical to the fight against climate change. To facilitate these research directions, the Milner group also synthesizes new materials for applications in electrochemistry, photocatalysis, and chemical separations.\nPublications\nKaitlyn T.

He was recruited to Pittsburgh in 2008. He has published high-impact articles at every stage of his academic career in journals including Science, Nature Biotechnology, Nature Medicine, and PNAS. Several of his inventions are licensed, one polymer he invented is now commercially available and approved for clinical use. He co-founded two companies to translate the technologies developed in his laboratory. His research focuses on creating biomaterials that will solve key challenges in the cardiovascular, nervous and musculoskeletal systems. His team enjoys collaboration with others who share the same passion for translational research.\nThe Wang Lab\u2019s most mature project is artery tissue engineering. We use a biodegradable elastomer to guide cells to make living arterial tissues as the polymer degrades. The unique design of the polymer allows the synthesis of a substantial amount of elastin quickly in the engineered arterial tissue, which had been a key challenge in tissue engineering. In order to facilitate clinical translation, we refined our approach to eliminate the need of cell seeding prior to the implantation of the arterial graft. Now the transformation from a synthetic polymeric tube into an elastic artery-like tissue occurs completely in the recipient body within a few months after implantation. This broke new grounds in tissue engineering and was reported in Nature Medicine in 2012. Science Translational Medicine called the work \u201ca departure from traditional tissue engineering\u201d. We are testing this in ovine and porcine models for application in peripheral arterial diseases, dialysis access and eventually coronary artery diseases.\nOur project on controlled drug delivery focuses on protein drugs. The only successful protein drugs are those of long half-lives, such as insulin and growth hormones. Growth factors are potent molecules that guides the essential cell functions including proliferation, differentiation, and migration. However, their short half-lives have limited their clinical use over the last few decades. Heparin binds many growth factors and greatly extends their half-lives in vivo. However, [heparin:growth factor] complexes are soluble in water and will spread throughout the body inducing significant side effects. We designed a biocompatible polycation that conjugate heparin and induce phase separation (termed complex coacervation) of the [heparin:growth factor] complex. The resultant precipitate enables spatial and temporal control of the release of the growth factors, increasing the efficacy while reducing the side effects.\nWe have recently embarked on a project in regenerative extracellular matrix (ECM). With the strong developmental biology expertise at Cornell, my lab will expand beyond synthetic polymeric biomaterials. Many evolutionarily simpler species have amazing regeneration capabilities. A well-known example is the limb regeneration of newt. Cells are undoubtedly important for this regeneration. However, in many cases, cell fate is controlled by the ECM. ECM has been investigated in regeneration medicine for decades. However, the focus of the field is on mammalian ECM. Many target organs in regenerative medicine, such as the heart and central nerve, do not regenerate in mammals. Instead, mammalian default repair mechanism in these organs is fibrosis. I believe it is possible to harvest the regenerative capability of primitive species using their ECM. When properly decellularized, the ECM will keep many of the signaling molecules that controls cell function. Thus using a healing ECM from a primitive species will likely help mammalian tissues to regenerate.\nMoving forward, I would like to initiate a project in collaboration with the computation experts at Cornell. With the presence of a very strong polymer science community at Cornell, I envision that close collaborations with polymer scientists will create biomaterials with more precise control over properties and more diverse functions. Clear guiding principles in biomaterials design and development are still elusive. A strong materiomics project that couples computation and experiments will advance this aspect of biomaterials science. I believe collectively biomaterials field has sufficient data on materials-biology interfaces that computational models will provide useful guidance on materials design.\nResearch Interests\nBiomedical Engineering\nBioengineering\nAdvanced Materials\nDrug Delivery and Nanomedicine\nTissue Engineering and Biomaterials\nSelect Publications\nWang, Yadong, J.

We use a biodegradable elastomer to guide cells to make living arterial tissues as the polymer degrades. The unique design of the polymer allows the synthesis of a substantial amount of elastin quickly in the engineered arterial tissue, which had been a key challenge in tissue engineering. In order to facilitate clinical translation, we refined our approach to eliminate the need of cell seeding prior to the implantation of the arterial graft.

They study in particular a myeloblastic hematological tumor cell line, HL-60, which retains the capability to undergo GO arrest and differentiation along either the myeloid or the monocytic lineages. For example, retinoic acid causes GO arrest and myeloid differentiation, whereas 1,25-dihydroxy vitamin D3, a ligand for another member of the same steriod thyroid hormone receptor superfamily, causes arrest and monocytic differentiation. This established cell line has been one of the archtypical models for studies of myelo-monopoiesis and hematopoietic differentiation. Because it is derived from a patient with acute promyelocytic leukemia, a disease where retinoic acid has now been found to induce temporary remissions while conventional chemotherapy has not been effective, there is significant motivation for understanding its mechanism of action. The current work focuses on what retinoid receptors are implicated in initiating the metabolic cascade culminating in GO arrest and cell differentiation, how that process is modulated by cell surface receptors such as c-FMS (the CSF-1 receptor) that use MAPK signaling, and how the RB (retinoblastoma tumor suppressor) protein may function as a downstream effector of these signals to regulate cell cycle and cell differentiation. One of the central scientific questions addressed in the laboratory is the cellular molecular mechanisms of myeloid and monocytic cell differentiation.\nThe application of basic principles elucidated in these in vitro studies is directed toward understanding the mechanism of teratogenic agents and also toward the rational design of differentiation induction therapy of cancer. Whereas conventional chemotherapy seeks to expunge the tumor stem cell population, this alternative seeks to nullify the proliferative activity and differetiatively immature hallmarks of the tumor by inducing terminal differentiation. The host can thus be relieved of the tumor burden. The hope is that this potential form of therapy will spare the host of the severely toxicity inherent in conventional chemotherapy. Significantly certain dietary factors and environmental pollutants can induce terminal differentiation of neoplastic cells. The molecular mechanism by which they act is being studied by the above.\nEducation\nPhD, Biophysics, Cornell University, 1976\nMS, Physics, University of Washington, 1970\nBA, Physics/Mathematics, Haverford College, 1969\nBiography/Professional Experience\nDr. Andrew Yen, a professor in the Department of Biomedical Sciences, is a member of several graduate fields.

Smith School of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering\nEmailwlo1@cornell.edu\nBiography\nProfessor Olbricht joined the Cornell faculty in 1980. He is professor of chemical and biomolecular engineering and biomedical engineering.\nOur research involves the application of fluid mechanics and mass transfer to problems of biological, biomedical and industrial interest. We focus on fundamentals that are relevant to broad classes of problems and also on technology development for specific applications.\nA recent example is convection-enhanced drug delivery, which is a novel method of delivering therapeutics to the brain for a variety of disorders, including some primary brain tumors. Convection-enhanced delivery bypasses the blood-brain barrier by infusing drugs through a needle directly into the interstitium. We are studying the transport of infused material in brain tissue and designing microfluidic catheters to improve the distribution of the infused therapeutics.\nWe are also interested in the motion of blood cells in the microcirculation, which affects oxygen and nutrient transport to tissue. One current application of interest involves a class of diseases that result in the over-production of red cells. This can result in significant changes in blood flow throughout vascular networks.\nMuch of our work on these problems involves microfabrication that is carried out at the Cornell NanoScale Science and Technology Center.\nResearch Interests\nDrug Delivery and Nanomedicine\nColloids and Interfacial Science\nHeat and Mass transfer\nNanotechnology\nBioengineering\nBiomedical Engineering\nMicrofluidics\nThermal Systems\nComplex Fluids and Polymers\nSelect Publications\nWang, P., William Lee Olbricht. 2011. \u201cFluid and Solid Mechanics in a Poroelastic Network Induced by Ultrasound.\u201d Journal of biomechanics 44 (1): 28-33.\nWang, Peng, William Lee Olbricht. 2011. \u201cFluid Mechanics in the Perivascular Space.\u201d Journal of theoretical biology 274: 52-57.\nHenderson, P.

      "biography": "Biography\nProfessor Olbricht joined the Cornell faculty in 1980. He is professor of chemical and biomolecular engineering and biomedical engineering.\nOur research involves the application of fluid mechanics and mass transfer to problems of biological, biomedical and industrial interest. We focus on fundamentals that are relevant to broad classes of problems and also on technology development for specific applications.\nA recent example is convection-enhanced drug delivery, which is a novel method of delivering therapeutics to the brain for a variety of disorders, including some primary brain tumors. Convection-enhanced delivery bypasses the blood-brain barrier by infusing drugs through a needle directly into the interstitium. We are studying the transport of infused material in brain tissue and designing microfluidic catheters to improve the distribution of the infused therapeutics.\nWe are also interested in the motion of blood cells in the microcirculation, which affects oxygen and nutrient transport to tissue. One current application of interest involves a class of diseases that result in the over-production of red cells. This can result in significant changes in blood flow throughout vascular networks.\nMuch of our work on these problems involves microfabrication that is carried out at the Cornell NanoScale Science and Technology Center."
